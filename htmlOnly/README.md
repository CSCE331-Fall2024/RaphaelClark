# Raphael-Webpage
Project 1 Description and Resources




# Overview
Your professional image is important for getting the job you want and representing yourself (and the organization you represent) well. It not only impacts your recruitment but helps you and your organization make valuable connections and grow. You want your professional presence on the Internet to promote the image you want to share. First impressions are vital, and your website has an impact on what impression you make. This project is something you can build upon during your career here at Texas A&M and can benefit you in your job or continuing education search.



# Project Mission
You will create a website that projects the professional image you would like recruiters and organizations to see when you introduce yourself.
You will develop the website on your local machine and host it on people.tamu.edu.
Your website will showcase the ability to toggle between multiple styles through CSS and JavaScript to completely change the look, feel, and layout of your website.
See CSS Zen Garden (http://csszengarden.com/Links to an external site.) for an example of the impact of different CSS files on HTML.
This will create a tool for you to share your professional portfolio and information about yourself even outside and beyond this course.


# Learning Objectives
Students who successfully complete this project will be able to:

Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build web pages.
Apply configuration management by creating and using a Git repository.
Integrate working in a local development environment and hosting a website on a server, including the ability to transfer files between them.
Provide, receive, and act on constructive peer reviews to improve the quality of work.


# Project Requirements
# General Requirements
## You will create and publish a website on people.tamu.edu:

## Your project should be built with only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
## You cannot use pre-made libraries or templates (e.g., Bootstrap is not allowed).
## Your project should have one HTML file per page.
## Your project should have one CSS file for each style.
## Your project should be consistently styled throughout in a way that gives a positive professional image.
## Your code should use consistent naming conventions, and should also consistent use of white space (e.g., indentation, spaces in control blocks, blank lines).
## One of the pages should include text of 300 words or more describing either yourself, your portfolio, your qualifications, or your service in more detail. 
## Your resume will not be included in this word count.
## This is part of the writing requirements of the class and must be passed to pass the course.
## This cannot be spread over multiple pages.
## You will use git for version control and GitHub to store the remote repository.
## You will become part of our class organization in GitHub so we can review your work.
 

# Pages Requirements
Your website will also contain at least 5 pages (one large scrollable/collapsable page is not acceptable).

# Landing area
Gives a positive first impression for a prospective employer or client.
Engages the audience to want to explore more, including interesting information that a prospective employer or organization would want to know.
Demonstrates your unique personality.
Shows how you would fit on someone's team and in their corporate culture.
Clear and concise, only including information that belongs here.
 

# Technical portfolio
Describes technical projects you have completed or would like to complete.
Provides interesting details for the audience which may include links to your TAMU GitHub repository for these projects, thumbnails, and descriptions.
 

# Qualifications section
Provides your resume in an easily accessible format (PDF preferred but HTML acceptable).
Describes your technical skills in addition listing them on your resume.
Discusses your technical areas of interest in Computer Science and why.
 

# Service section
Describes ways you give back to your community, either through volunteering, mentoring, or other similar activities (may include areas you would like to contribute to if not already).
 

# AI-generated page
Use an AI tool (e.g. ChatGPT) to create one additional page.

This page does not have to change styles with the others.
The topic of the page can be (almost) anything
e.g. It can present the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI).
it should be professional
it should be relevant to you and your interests
Start with a simple prompt.
Continue to add to the prompt until you are satisfied with the output.
Create a text box in the new page (ChatGPT can do this for you) that contains the prompt you used in the final version of your AI-generated page.
 

# Navigation Requirements
Have clear and consistent navigation for your pages.

# Internal links
Every page you create must be linked from some other page.
The "Landing area" page must have links to all other pages.
 

# External links
Minimum of 10 different links to external web pages that are relevant to you and the work you are doing.
Appropriately placed throughout your project (not on a single “links” section).
 

# Style toggle feature
Completely changes the look, feel, and layout of the website.
To accomplish this, do not edit your CSS from the initial design. Start over with a new CSS file, plan the layout, then implement the plan.  (Things like going to dark mode, changing background and font colors are not sufficient.)
Uses a button or checkbox that changes the appearance of the website by alternating between different CSS files with JavaScript.
Examples:
See CSS Zen Garden (http://csszengarden.com/Links to an external site.) for an example of the impact of different CSS files on HTML.
See an sample (https://people.tamu.edu/~rob.light/CSCE315/zen.html) to see only the HTML required to build the same CSS Zen Garden web site.
Or use the web developer tools in your browser to turn off CSS on the CSS Zen Garden page(s).
 



# Timeline for Deliverables
## Week 2
Draft project website including all contained webpages with HTML only.
Sketch a webpage layout and style.
Submit your layout sketch.
Create a stylesheet to implement your sketch.
Use GitHub to manage all project files (use the repo in the GitHub classroom organization).
Submit in Canvas the following:
your landing page link
should look like: people.tamu.edu/~yourNetID
your landing page's HTML ONLY link
your TAMU GitHub link
Sketch a second webpage layout and style that is completely different than the first.
Submit your layout sketch.

## Week 3
Create a stylesheet to implement your second sketch.
Implement a toggle button/checkbox using JavaScript to go between the two different stylesheets.
Revise the project website, including all contents of web pages based on peer-reviewed feedback.
Update your GitHub repository files accordingly.
Submit your final landing page link to Canvas.


# Peer Review
We will hold a peer review workshop during one of the lab sessions.
You will participate in both giving and receiving constructive feedback to other students in your class.
After the peer review workshop, you should incorporate any appropriate suggestions to your website before submitting the final version.
Participation in the Peer Review, including the updates you make, is part of the Writing Requirements of this course. 


# A Word on Academic Integrity
This project is an individual assignment.

Your work should be completed individually and will be evaluated individually.
Previous websites from your own effort, or other classes should not be used. Follow these guidelines for your web page.
If you took this course previously, you must show at least 25% change on every page, including content and style.
Even though there is a peer review component to this project, this is not a team assignment. 
Below, you will find helpful resources and tutorials for your project.

You may use other tutorials on the internet, but you may not use someone else's code, whether they are associated with this class or not.
If you want to use a template, you must get approval first.
When in doubt whether a resource is approved, assume it is not and ask your instructor and TAs.
If you have created other websites in the past, you may link to those in your portfolio page.

It is not acceptable to turn in previous work from outside this class for this project.
It should be clear what work was done prior to this project.
While there are some facts that will be the same from the previous work to this project, the look, feel, and design should flow from the goal of this project.
When in doubt, consult your instructor and TAs.
Finally, remember to give constructive feedback during the peer review workshop.

The Aggie Honor Code applies here as well.
