            <h3>Dungeon Crawler</h3>
                <p class = "ProjectsP">
                    This was a project where 
                    I made a command line puzzle 
                    video game in which you are trying 
                    to escape a maze of monsters, 
                    I used 2D array manipulation as well 
                    as state checking and matrix math to 
                    impliment many of the features of the game. 
                    It was a fun project overall and took some time to complete, but I feel like it is very 
                    fulfilling to create a project that is interactive like this
                </p >
            <h3>std::Vector</h3>
                <p class = "ProjectsP">
                    In this project I recreated the std::vector class using dynamic arrays.
                </p>
            <h3>std::unordered_map</h3>
                <p class = "ProjectsP">
                    In this project I recreated the std::unordered_map class using vectors, hashing, and iterators.
                </p>
            <h3>std::linked_list</h3>
                <p class = "ProjectsP">
                    In this project I recreated the Linked List include using connected pointers and some math.
                </p>
            <h3>std::graph</h3>
                <p class = "ProjectsP">
                    In this project I recreated the unordered and ordered graph classes using something simaler to linked lists but with more than one connection.
                </p>
            <h3>PriorityQueue</h3>
                <p class = "ProjectsP">
                    In this project and another like it I recreated a stack class, a queue class, and a priority queue class
                </p>

                <h3>Coding with Functional Programming</h3>
                    <p>
                        In this coding language, I made a few projects that 
                        implimented a lot of the key features of functional programming using recursion.
                        I made functions that utilized recursion, pairs and higher order objet types, folding, mapping, and filters.
                        I created functions that could pass through higher order functions as well as use first class functions.
                        I also created combining functions that ustilized all of these things to make some amazing functions with cool utilities.

            <h2>Racket</h2>
                <h3>Streams, Sequences, Cycles, and Assoc</h3>
                    <p>
                        One of my first projects in Racket was utilizing Streams, Sequences, Cycles, and an Assoc (finds something)
                        and creating them from scratch with simple functional programming in Racket
                    </p>
                <h3>Making a Programming Language Interpreter</h3>
                    <p>
                        In this project I made something that I consider to be one of the most difficult and entertaining things I have ever created. 
                        A MUPL, or a made up programming language is something that uses a current language to make a new language with its own syntax and tokens, 
                        but using the foundation of another language. This was Racket for me. In the end, my programming language could recognize all the basic variable types
                        in addition to being able to recognize things like functions, classes, and environments. the language could use higher order functions, and fold, map, and filter things.
                        It was a great endeavor and a difficult project but was very fun and incitefull.

            <h2>Ruby</h2>
                <h3>Tetris</h3>
                <p>
                    In this project in Ruby I studied class hierarchy and used it to make add ons and recreate a beloved game known as Tetris.
                    It was a very fun project, most video games are, and I found it very entertaining to make something as fun as it.
