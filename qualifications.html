        <h2>LZ-Technologies Inc.</h2>
        <p>
            LZ-Technologies is where I had my first internship. They are a Technology Development Contractor 
            company that works with NASA and many interns for the future of technology. In the past few summers 
            that I was here, I worked on and developed numerous pieces of software ranging on topics from signal-decoders, displays, data-transfer and organization software and much more.
            A signifigant portion of the internship was also spent debugging and helping to fix and sometimes start new projects. Click on the image to go to their site.
